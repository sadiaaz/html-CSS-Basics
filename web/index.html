    <h1>Computer</h1>
    <hr>
    <pre>
    <p>A computer is an electronic device that takes data (input), processes it using stored
         instructions (software), and produces results (output), all while storing information
          for future use, operating on binary code (0s and 1s). They range from tiny smartphones 
          to massive supercomputers, combining physical parts (hardware like keyboards, screens)
           with programs (software like web browsers, apps) to perform countless tasks in business,
            education, and entertainment. </p></pre>

<h1>Networking</h1>
<pre>
<p>Networking is broadly about connecting devices or people, often for sharing
     resources/information; in tech, it's linking computers via protocols
      (LANs, Internet) using hardware like routers for data exchange, while professionally,
       it's building relationships with peers for career growth, job opportunities,
        and shared knowledge, using platforms like LinkedIn or events. Both fields 
        involve creating pathways (physical or social) to facilitate communication
         and mutual benefit. </p></pre>
